    <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
    <p>This website is a personal project where I share my journey in learning web development. You will find different sections like About Me, Projects, and a Blog where I document my learning process and experiences.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a beginner web developer with a passion for coding and technology. I started learning HTML and CSS recently and aim to become proficient in JavaScript and backend development. My goal is to build useful applications that can help others.</p>
    <h3>Skills and Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>Currently, I am focusing on mastering the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also aim to learn how to use version control systems like Git and GitHub for collaborative projects. In the future, I plan to explore frameworks such as React and Node.js.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>One of my recent projects was creating a simple website using HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a portfolio site that showcases my projects and skills. I am constantly improving it as I learn more, and I look forward to adding new features like interactivity with JavaScript.</p>
